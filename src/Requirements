U/I FORUM REQUIREMENTS:

Description

Write a program that asks the user to enter information about a particular good or service
(it could be an album, game, book, car, etc). Ask for at least five different attributes,
like title, author, and genre. Save the information to a file as a JSON object. When the program
runs again, it should read the file and print out the data, then give the user the option to update it.

Requirements

Prompt the user to answer at least five different questions about a good or service.
Save the information into a JSON object in a file.
When the program first boots, read the file and display the contents.
Give the user the ability to update the information and re-save it to the file.
If the JSON parsing fails, give a friendly error rather than crashing the program.
HARDMODE

Write a test for the save/load methods.
